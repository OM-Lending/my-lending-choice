## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create a shared blog post data source (slug, title, excerpt, author, category, date, read time, hero, structured content).
- [x] 1.2 Update `/blog` listing to consume the shared data, render metadata-rich cards, and wire Read More links to `/blog/{slug}`.
- [x] 1.3 Add dynamic blog detail route that renders hero/header, metadata bar, rich content sections, and conversion CTA blocks.
- [x] 1.4 Add metadata generation for `/blog` and per-post pages using title/description derived from the data source.
- [x] 1.5 Add lightweight validation (lint/build + manual smoke for listing/detail navigation) and adjust any issues found.
- [x] 1.6 Run `openspec validate add-blog-read-more --strict`.
